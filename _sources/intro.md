## Installation 

In order to install steers-test, proceed with the following steps:

- git-clone steers-test into local folder: `git clone https://github.com/luetha/steers-test.git`
- enter folder: `cd steers-test`
- create virtual environment using conda: `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
- activate environment: `conda activate steers-test`

```{note}
The default implementation of `conda` can be very slow in putting together an actual python environment because it has to solve a difficult puzzle to ensure that the combination of packages is mutually compatible. Fortunately, there is a much faster alternative called [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). With Mamba you can install environments and packages as before, but using the `mamba` comand instead of `conda`.
