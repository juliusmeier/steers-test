# Proof of Concept

The STEERS methodology presented in D2-3 Draft Methodology undergoes a Proof of concept (POC). In this context, POC is defined as:
“A proof of concept (POC) is a demonstration, the purpose of which is to verify that certain concepts or theories have the potential for real-world application. […] The POC provides evidence that demonstrates that a business model, product, service, system, or idea is feasible and will function as intended.“ {cite}`Harrington_2016` 

Along the guides by Harrington and Voehl {cite}`Harrington_2016` and in accordance with Prasanna {cite}`Prasanna_2021`, the POC includes four steps of which (2) is extensively presented in the deliverable D2-3 Draft Methodology.

1.	definition of success criteria,
2.	engineering of a proposed solution,
3.	evaluation of proposed solution against success criteria, 
4.	decision to proceed.

This POC is a qualitative exercise and uses predefined criteria to verify that the methodology is compliant with regulatory boundaries and feasible in terms of effort and technical requirements.
